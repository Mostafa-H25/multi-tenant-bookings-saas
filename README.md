# 🛠️ Smart Booking System — Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform

## 📌 Project Overview

A smart, multi-tenant booking system built using **Laravel** (API backend), **Vue 3** (web frontend), and **React Native** (mobile app for providers). The platform enables service-based businesses to manage appointments, services, users, and payments — with isolated data per business (tenant).

---

## 🌍 Context

Small and medium-sized service providers like salons, clinics, and freelancers struggle with manual or outdated scheduling tools. This project offers a centralized SaaS solution that gives each provider their own booking portal and admin panel, all while sharing a unified codebase.
